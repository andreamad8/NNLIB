MLP model, with backpropagation algorithm for the gradient descend. In the model
we included momentum and an L2 regularization parameter. As validation technique
we used a 5 fold cross validation. The final parameters we have used in this
model are Hidden Unit = 25, Learning rate = 0.05, Momentum = 0.6, lambda=0.0001.
